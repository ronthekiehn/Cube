# Cube
Terminal cube in C (with a little Python)

## Instructions
First, make sure you have pynput installed in python. This can easily be done with `pip install pynput`.

Then, run `make` to compile the program. And finally, run `./cube` to run the code. 

If your terminal is in light mode, run `./cube light` to reverse the lighting conditions.
